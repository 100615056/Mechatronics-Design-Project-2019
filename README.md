# Mechatronics-Design-Project-2019

Create an autonomous Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) vechicle to autonomously navigate through a maze.

## Phase C - Final

- Calculate the wheel positions and wheel speeds and convert them from encoder values to distance measurements; correcting for systematic odemtry errors using equations
-  Apply the PID controller to each indidivual wheel
-  Convert speed values to PWM values and ensure values are within acceptable range
-  Apply Wheel Odometry and Waypoints to apply the Dead Reckoning Alogrithm to navigate through the maze
